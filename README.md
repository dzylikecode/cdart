# cdart

During the process of binding raylib to Dart, the goal is to maintain compatibility with C. In this experimental process, C code can be almost directly copied to Dart with only minor modifications. At this point, it became clear how similar Dart and C are—Dart is essentially C with built-in garbage collection.
